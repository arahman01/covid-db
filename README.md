# covid-db

We are going through challenging times due to the corona virus pandemic
that has swept the world. Technology is at the forefront of the battle against
Covid-19. It is of prime importance to have a central database pertaining to
the virus to track and analyze its spread. It is pivotal in Covid-19 management
efforts and without it, all measures are useless.
Keeping this in mind, we are aiming to create Covid-19 cases management
database that provides the proper storage of data relating to patients, cases,
quarantine centers, and all necessary information.
This database could be used to analyze information to monitor virus growth
in specific areas. Activities in hospital and quarantine centers will also be
recorded to provide a complete understanding of the capacities and
conditions under which the hospitals are operating. This database will also
track the travel history of all patients, domestically and internationally,
enabling it to predict patterns in cases and identifying potential Covid-19
hotspots.

Technologies used: PHP, MYSQLi, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Chart Js, XAMPP
